  utter_tell_diff_bw_corr_and_vif:
  - text: "Correlation and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) are both used to analyse and weigh relationships between variables in your target dataset, but they serve different purposes and provide different types of information. \nFor instance, Correlations measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. Or, in other words, it helps in understanding how one variable changes with respect to another.\n\nOn the other hand, VIF measures the amount of multi-collinearity among the predictor variables in a regression model. By multi-collinearity; I mean that it quantifies how much the variance of a regression coefficient is inflated due to multi-collinearity. As a guiding principle; Data Scientists want to avoid multi-collinearity among independent variables as much as possible; since otherwise the results will have less reliable statistical inferences."
